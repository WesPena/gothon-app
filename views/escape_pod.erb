	You rush through the ship desperately trying to make it to<br>
	the escape pod before the whole ship explodes.  It seems like<br>
	hardly any Gothons are on the ship, so your run is clear of<br>
	interference.  You get to the chamber with the escape pods, and<br>
	now need to pick one to take.  Some of them could be damaged<br>
	but you don't have time to look.  There's 2 pods, which one<br>
	do you take?<br>
